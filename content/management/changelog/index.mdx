This document is the record of all the changes in [the Configuration API](/management/configuration-api/) starting from **version 3.0**. What you **won't find** here is the list of changes between versions 2.0 and 3.0 of the Configuration API.

Switching from v2.0 to v3.0 was more than an upgrade - it was rather a migration. That's why some parts of the configuration, such as managing canned responses or greetings, can be done only via the [Configuration API v2.0](/management/configuration-api/v2.0/), while other, like managing webhooks or properties, via [the Configuration API v3.1](/management/configuration-api/).

Since the migration is still ongoing, different parts will be successively moved from **the Configuration API v2.0** to **v3.x**.

## [v3.2] - Developer Preview

### Added

- The `agent_ids` filter was added to the [`agent_deleted`](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#triggering-actions) webhook.
- The `agent_status_changed` webhook was replaced with [`routing_status_set`](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#routing_status_set).
- There's a new field, `license_id`, in all [webhooks](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#webhooks).
- From now on, it's possible to define properties in [2 new locations](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#property-locations): `license` and `group`.
- There are 6 new methods: [**Set License Properties**](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#set-license-properties), [**Get License Properties**](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#get-license-properties), [**Delete License Properties**](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#delete-license-properties), [**Set Group Properties**](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#set-group-properties), [**Get Group Properties**](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#get-group-properties), [**Delete Group Properties**](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#delete-group-properties).

### Changed

- The [**Create Bot Agent**](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#create-bot-agent) method no longer accepts the `status` parameter. The initial value is now `__offline__`.
- The [**Update Bot Agent**](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#update-bot-agent) method no longer accepts the `status` parameter. To change the Bot Agent's status, use [**Set Routing Status**](/messaging/agent-chat-api/v3.2/rtm-reference/#set-routing-status) from **the Agent Chat API**.
- You can now update other Bot Agents within the same license. To do that, call the [**Update Bot Agent**](/management/configuration-api/v3.2/#update-bot-agent) method with the `agents-bot--all:rw` scope.

### Removed

- The `agent_status_changed` webhook was removed.

## [v3.1] - 2019-09-17

### Changed

- The `data` field in webhooks was renamed to `payload`.
